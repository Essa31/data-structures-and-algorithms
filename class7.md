## Approach & Efficiency

I followed the approach that the code takes the least time and space, where B(o) takes space and time and be simple to be easy to understand

## Solution
    def kth_From_End(self,k):
        concurrent = self.head
        item = []
        while concurrent:
            item += f'{concurrent.value}'
            concurrent = concurrent.next
        x=item[::-1]
        l=len(item)
        if k >= 0:
            if k <= l-1 :
                return x[k]
            else:
                return "Exception"

        else:
            return "Exception"
